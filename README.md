I ran out of time to research how to change my ratings into stars when published on the browser.  
I managed to get my reviews from supabase to display on the browser and I managed to have my submitted forms turn into an object... it is unclear to me if they went to the server/db because I could not get them back.  
I encountered an error with my endpoints that I could not resolve so I opted to leave it and begin styling.

- Seed your database with realistic-looking ‘dummy’ data through the Supabase query editor or a seed file in your server. Ensure that this is saved and submitted (in a screenshot or seed file form) so it can be marked and tested efficiently.
